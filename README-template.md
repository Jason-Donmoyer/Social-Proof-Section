## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- Start version control with git and create a new project on Github.
- Get the page live on Github Pages.
- Go through the starter code and markup the HTML file.
- Create a style sheet.
- Add imports for fonts and variables for colors and font styles.
- I use a mobile first approach to begin styling.
- After the mobile styles are complete, begin styles for larger device sizes.
- For this project there is not a design for tablet sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The mobile design was not nearly as challenging as the desktop design. My biggest issue was getting the
breakpoints to work properly when switching back to a mobile device. I raised the breakpoint value to display the mobile design right up to where there would be no overlapping of elements on the screen. I'm sure I could have made the parent containers larger to allow for flex wrap, but wanted to keep the look as close to the design as possible. This is also the first project where I used all rem values for the design elements. I like the way it worked for displaying the page on different devices. I liked using relative positioning to style the desktop design.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to use Flexbox ans CSS Grid for layout. My goal is to be able to style any design with confidence. I can then focus more time on my JavaScript coding skills.
